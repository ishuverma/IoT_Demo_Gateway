== Purpose
This repository is part of a series of three, which in combination resemble an
Internet of Things ( IoT ) demo-environment, based on the 3-Layered architecture of

* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Sensors[Edge / Sensors]: creation of data
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway[Smart Gateway / Controller]: first level of data processing
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Datacenter[Datacenter]: well, the datacenter ...

These layers can - and in this demo will - be made out of a set of
Red Hat JBoss products, each taking over an important part in the IoT landscape

== Gateway
In your classical IoT architecture the Gateway can provide various capabilities, like

* local access point for sensors
* first aggregation point for sensor data
* "normalization" of sensor data
* forwarding sensor data to datacenter

With this much logic in the Gateway, it is more then fair to call it a "Smart Gateway"

== Architecture
=== Running on dedicated hardware
The Smart Gateway is build based on the following technologies

* Intel X86 or Atom Processor ( I'm using http://wiki.minnowboard.org/MinnowBoard_Turbot[Minnowboard Turbot] )
* Any Linux distribution ( I'm using https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[Red Hat Enterprise Linux V7.x] )
* https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=41301[JBoss Fuse] for the required messaging and integration capabilities.

Installation instructions for a Smart Gateway can be found http://www.opensourcerers.org/building-a-rasperry-pi-based-smart-gateway-for-iot/[here] and for "lazy" people http://www.opensourcerers.org/building-the-iot-smart-gateway-for-the-lazy-ones-ansible-rules/[here].

== Build, Configure and Run Smart Gateway
=== Preparation Steps
To be able to run the Smart Gateway, as proposed here, you will have to prepare the following

* git
* Maven ( I'm on V 3.3.9 )
* Ansible ( I'm on V 2.0.0.2 )
* Docker ( I'm running docker-machine V1.9.1 )
* docker-compose ( I'm running V1.5.2 )
* two network devices, at least one WLAN device

With all this prepared, all you need to do is to to clone the repo

```
pi@gateway:~ $ cd
pi@gateway:~ $ git clone -b Minnowboard https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway.git
```
if you want run on X86/Atom based systems, or
```
pi@gateway:~ $ cd
pi@gateway:~ $ git clone https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway.git
```
for Raspberry Pi.

After cloning the repo, you will have to download and put https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=41311[JBoss Fuse on Karaf] into the directory `./IoT_Demo_SmartGateway/Fuse/Docker_Files/software/`

=== Building the Gateway
After cloneing, you only need to enter the newly created directory and run the `build.sh` script.
```
pi@gateway:~ $ cd IoT_Demo_Gateway
pi@gateway:~ $ ./build.sh
```

=== Configure Environment
Before you can start the Smart Gateway, you will have to do a small configuration task.
This is required, as the Smart Gateway is designed to be flexible about the surrounding
environment.

Please do open the file 'docker-compose.yml' in your favorite editor and change the
entries which define the environment variables for the messaging broker IP addresses and
ports

1. In section `smartgateway`:

  ** `INBOUND_JMS_BROKER_URL` is the fully qualified URL for the ActiveMQ Broker running on the Gateway this will usually be `tcp://localhost:61616`

  ** `OUTBOUND_JMS_BROKER_URL` is the fully qualified URL for the ActiveMQ Broker where the Complex Event Processing ( CEP ) will expect messages to arrive. In this setup this will also be `tcp://localhost:61616`

  ** `DATACENTER_JMS_BROKER_URL` is the fully qualified URL for the ActiveMQ Broker running the Datacenter part of the demo setup.

  ** `BROKER_ADMIN_UID` the user-id of the user which authenticates at the Gateway. In the demo-setup this will usually be `admin`

  ** `BROKER_ADMIN_PASSWD` the password for the user. This will usually be `change12_me` in the default demo setup.

2. In section `rulescep`

  ** `SOURCE_AMQ_BROKER` is the fully qualified URL for the ActiveMQ Broker from which CEP will receive messages. Usually this will be `tcp://smartgateway:61616`
  ** `TARGET_AMQ_BROKER` is the fully qualified URL for the ActiveMQ Broker where CEP will deliver messages. In my setup this is `tcp://192.168.178.97:61616`
  ** `SOURCE_QUEUE` name of queue on `SOURCE_AMQ_BROKER` where CEP will receive messages from. Should be `message.to.rules_cep`
  ** `TARGET_QUEUE` name of queue on `TARGET_AMQ_BROKER` where CEP will deliver messages to. Should be `message.to.datacenter`
  ** `BROKER_ADMIN_UID` the user-id of the user which authenticates at the Gateway. In the demo-setup this will usually be `admin`
  ** `BROKER_ADMIN_PASSWD` the password for the user. This will usually be `change12_me` in the default demo setup.

Once you changed these values, you are ready to go.

=== Start Environment
Starting the Smart Gateway is, at the current time, a manual step. I will extend
the demo to start the Smart Gateway container automatically at boot-time of the Raspberry.

Until then, please start the Smart Gateway with

```
pi@gateway:~ $ cd IoT_Demo_Gateway/
pi@gateway:~/IoT_Demo_Gateway $ docker-compose up -d
```

To "monitor" the startup or runtime of the Smart Gateway you can use the command

```
pi@gateway:~/IoT_Demo_Gateway $ docker-compose logs
Attaching to iotdemogateway_smartgateway_1
smartgateway_1 | Please wait while JBoss Fuse is loading...
100% [========================================================================]
```

Once you see the `100%` you are good to go!

WARNING: The Smart Gateway will try to access the JMS Broker defined under `TARGET_AMQ_BROKER`.
If this broker should not be available, the start if the Gateway will fail.
